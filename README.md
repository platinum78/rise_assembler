## 1. How to Install

### 1.1. System Requirements

This package is written an tested on **Ubuntu 16.04 + ROS Kinetic** environment. Dependencies are also for this environment.

### 1.2. Dependencies Prerequisites

There are a number of dependencies in this package, since the ABB robot is operated by ROS-Industrial package. Please install all the packages listed below in your Ubuntu PC, in the given order.

* ros-kinetic-desktop-full
* ros-kinetic-industrial-core
* ros-kinetic-industrial-msgs
* ros-kinetic-industrial-robot-client
* ros-kinetic-industrial-robot-simulator
* ros-kinetic-industrial-utils
* ros-kinetic-abb
* abb_experimental [1]
* ros-kinetic-moveit

    [1] abb_experimental is literally *experimental*, so it is not configured as an `.deb` packag. Therefore, it should be downloaded from the Github reposity. Do `git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_experimental` inside `${ros_workspace}/src`.

Now,Extract the metapackage `rise_assembler` into `${ros_workspace}/src`. `catkin_make` your workspace.

## 3. How to Use

### 3.1. CLI Controller

You can use the CLI controller. Type `rosrun rise_assembler assembler_manual_controller` in the terminal, and you will get a CLI controller displayed up on your console. To see the list of commands, type `h` and `Enter`.

### 3.2. GUI Controller

You can use the GUI controller. Type `rosrun rise_assembler assembler_gui_controller` in the terminal, and then the GUI console will pop out. This program is not complete yet, so it might be prone to errors. Please be careful when using the program.

### 3.3. Path-Planning APIs

The script `assembler_controller.py` provides a convenient method to plan paths. One should give the pose of end-effector in the following form; [x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw].

* `move_to_pose()`: move to designated pose 
* `move_by_cartesian_path()`: move to designated pose, in straight path.
* `rotate_joint()`: rotate specific joint by desiged angle. This method gets the angles of all 6 joints, add the given value to specified joint, and then makes the robot go to that configuration. Therefore, the joints that are not designated to move might move by a little angle, due to controller errors.
